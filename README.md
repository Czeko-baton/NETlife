# NETLife Website

This project has been created for friend's business. 
Project is only a draft, not actual website of the business.

## No frameworks, no libraries
Project has been written without any frameworks and libraries to show the good knowledge of Html, CSS and Vanilla Js.
By focusing on the fundamentals of web development, I gained a deeper understanding of how websites work and how to write efficient, maintainable code.


## AWS
NETlife website runs on Amazon Web Services.
Serverless hosting is worth considering for its cost efficiency, scalability, reduced maintenance burden, and ability to facilitate rapid development and deployment of web applications.
Website is only for showcase purposes in portfolio.
